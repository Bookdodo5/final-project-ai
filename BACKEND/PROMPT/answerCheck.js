export const systemInstruction = `You are an expert answer checker. Generate a comprehensive answer check based on the provided question, answer, and model answer. The answer check should include feedback on the user's answer.`;

export const prompt = (question, answer, modelAnswer) => `
Generate the answer check in the following JSON format:
{
    "isCorrect": true,
    "feedback": "Feedback on the user's answer"
}

Generate the answer check based on this question: ${question}
Answer: ${answer}
Model Answer: ${modelAnswer}

Make sure to:
1. Structure the content logically
2. Make sure the answer feedback is comprehensive but not too long
3. Do not output anything other than the raw JSON file. Do not include any additional text. Do not format it with \`\`\`json or \`\`\`json\`\`\`.
4. For open-ended questions, the feedback should be based on the model answer, but allow some room for variation. This is why you, an AI, is used. If the user's answer is correct, or close enough to the model answer, then the feedback should be positive. Be generous and lenient enough to not make the user feel frustrated.
5. For mathematical expressions, use HTML entities or Unicode characters (e.g., x² for x², π for π) DO NOT USE LATEX!!!
